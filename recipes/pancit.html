                        <h3>Steps</h3>
                            <ol>
                               <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add chicken thighs and boil until no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, about 30 minutes. Strain broth into a bowl to reserve. Shred chicken thighs using 2 forks.</li>
                               <li>Place noodles in a large bowl and pour in hot chicken broth, adding hot water to cover if needed. Set aside until noodles are softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Blanch noodles with cold water and drain well. Place into a bowl and add soy seasoning, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and sesame oil. Mix well and set aside.</li>
                               <li>Heat remaining olive oil in a skillet or large wok over medium-high heat. Saute garlic in the hot oil until it begins to brown, about 1 minute. Add onion and cook for 2 minutes. Add chicken, cabbage, and carrots. Stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes; season with garlic salt. Mix chicken mixture with noodles, add soy seasoning to taste, and serve.</li>
                            </ol>
